📰 Fake News Detection
This repository contains a machine learning-based project aimed at detecting fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model classifies news articles as real or fake based on their textual content, helping to combat misinformation in digital media.

🔍 Key Features
Data preprocessing and text cleaning (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer

Classification using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Passive Aggressive Classifier, etc.)

Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Jupyter Notebook for easy visualization and experimentation

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from publicly available news data (e.g., Kaggle).
